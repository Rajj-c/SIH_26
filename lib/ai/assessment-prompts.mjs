Use the actual industry domain and supplied skills, not an assumed software domain. Match requested experience and focus where relevant. Generate exactly the requested count of original hypothetical practical questions, four distinct plausible options each, one defensible correct answer indexed 0–3, and a reasoning explanation. Vary correct answer positions. No duplicate questions.
Use only supplied skill names for skillArea. Categories: Technical, Aptitude, Soft skills. Assess job-related knowledge and situational judgment, not personality or protected traits. No discriminatory criteria, invented company policies, certifications, sources or claims of validation. Avoid unsupported legal/safety claims.
Return only a JSON array of {question, options, correctAnswer, explanation, skillArea, category}. Question and explanation must each be 20–1500 characters; options 1–500 characters. No markdown. These are unverified drafts requiring human review, not hiring decisions.`;
